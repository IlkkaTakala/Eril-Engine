# Naming Conventions and Other Stuff
## Naming
Naming is not the most important aspect, but everything should be readable and understandable. Below are some guidelines to assist naming.
### Classes
Classes should be named clearly and descriptively. Name should start with a Capital letter, e.g. Name or TwoName.

### Member Variables
Member variables are named similarly to classes, e.g VariableOne. Boolean variables can be started with lower case 'b' or the word 'is' (bAlive, isAlive). 

### Variables in functions
Temporary variables are named freely, preferably with lower case letters (thisVariable, this_variable). Keep naming consistent within files.
